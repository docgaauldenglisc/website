        <h1>THIS IS DAY SIX</h1>
        <hr>
        <p class="blogtext">Made some changes to the previously listed songs page. So far, however, it seems like it's a pain to maintain so 
                            I might have to end up completely changing it. Also moved the blog stuff around, this is less of a blog or some kind of posting area so it's going
                            into a changelog section.</p>

        <hr>
        <p class="blogtext">The website is now hosted on neocities and open to the public! How boring is that! In other news, new logo for the todo list. Additionally, there were
                            some changes to the website layout to make it a little more portable among computer platforms. If you're looking at this on a phone, you may want to 
                            reconsider.</p>

        <p class="blogtext">Changed the iframe today!! It was going to be a cool terminal written in javascript with like hacker green text and stuff but I decided to not try and incorporate
        that into a website design, because I thought that would be annoying as hell.</p>
